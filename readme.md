This is a simple dice game web app that I used to test out DOM manipulation using javaScript.

It was a fun little project. If you're a beginner, DON'T copy and paste. Read, understand and try to recreate on your own.

This was part of the Udemy course thought by Angela Yu, highly recommend any course thought by her.
